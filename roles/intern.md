# Internship programme


Our programme offers you the ability to work on high value public code projects used around the world, improving the role of technology in society. You will be helping to make public-purpose software and policy – used for example in cities and other public organizations – be more open and collaborative. 

[The Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net) helps public organizations develop and maintain software and policy together. We provide review of codebases that are in our stewardship to help developers build trusted and reliable software that can be widely reused and foster a strong community around it.

We test against the [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/) to make codebases understandable, reusable and community based. Our standards are high, as well as opinionated, to ensure codebases can be trusted as the infrastructure of society and improve continually, and policy makers can keep technology and architectural choices open.

## What interns do
As a prospective intern we ask you to send us a proposal on how you see yourself fit best within the Foundation's activities, based on the information below, your skills and your interests. 

### Join as junior codebase stewards
As a junior [codebase steward](https://publiccode.net/codebase-stewardship/) you will be paired with and mentored by one of our senior codebase stewards to make the Foundation's codebases more trusted, reliable and reusable. 

For more information on our four types of codebase stewards please see:
* [Quality - help make codebases more reusable](quality.md)
* [Community - help people work together on codebases](community.md)
* [Product - help make codebases more attractive](product-marketing.md)
* [Support - help people reuse existing codebases](support.md)

### Join as a general intern 
As a growing organization we also regularly need help from talented indivudals on transversal issues. This could range from researching and developing case studies on the economics of open source for public use, improving how we measure impact, organizing epic events, or supporting ongoing operations in an open-by-default and community-driven organization.

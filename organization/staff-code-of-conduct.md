# Staff code of conduct

The staff of the Foundation for Public Code fulfills a crucial role in achieving our mission on behalf of our members, the wider community and the public benefit.

The Foundation for Public Code is a trusted non-partisan organization that operates in sectors of the economy that have significant political interests.
It is crucial that the organization as well as its staff are visibly independent, trustworthy, impartial and objective.

## Community code of conduct

Staff are expected to follow the general [code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to our community.

The staff code of conduct sets out the additional expectations we have of our staff beyond the community code of conduct.

## Conflicts of interest

Any personal interest or any interest in any business or organization that could compromise the respect of these obligations must be declared immediately.

Outside activities covered by these rules, paid or unpaid, must first be approved.
Staff members must also inform their manager if a personal interest that might impair their independence or any other conflict of interest occurs, in the course of performance of their duties.

Staff members must also inform their manager if they discover:

* a personal interest that might impair their independence
* any other conflict of interest occurs

## Receiving gifts

Staff may not accept gifts, payment or favours from non-member organizations, individuals or third parties without prior permission.

Gifts may only be accepted without prior approval when:

* there is a cultural, social or diplomatic obligation to accept the gift
* the value of the gift does not exceed €50
* there is no accumulation

Hospitality included in participation in an approved mission, conference, workshop or other meeting does not require separate approval.

## Language

Use English for all communication between staff.
Minimize the use of jargon and avoid abbreviations and acronyms.

## Secret information

While we strive to be an open and transparent organization whenever possible, there are always communications that are sensitive.
Any communication that should never end up in the public domain is secret.
Maintaining a clear distinction between what can and cannot be shared is essential for running an organization that [aims to be as open as possible](../activities/communication/communication-principles.md).

All secret communication must be marked with the word '**Secret**' and clearly state:

* who made it secret, the **owner**
* who may view it, the **access**
* why it is secret, the **reason**

It is the duty of the owner – and their managers – to update or remove the secret classification when needed.

## Security

Report any potential vulnerability or threat to security immediately to <security@publiccode.net>.

This covers both information security and physical security of our staff and the organization.

Keys, including passwords, building keys and bank cards should be strictly personal wherever possible.
All digital keys should be managed with the staff password manager and not shared outside of it.

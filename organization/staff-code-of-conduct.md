# Staff code of conduct

Staff of the Foundation for Public Code fulfills a crucial role in achieving our mission on behalf of our members, the wider community, and the public benefit.

As the Foundation for Public Code is a non-partisan organization that operates in sectors of the economy that have significant political interests it is crucial that the organization as well as its staff are visibly independent, impartial, and objective.

## Community code of conduct

Staff are expected to follow the general [code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to our community. The code of conduct is effectively a part of this staff code of conduct.

## Conflict of interest

Any personal interest or any interest in any business or organisation that could compromise the respect of these obligations must be declared immediately.

Outside activities covered by these rules, paid or unpaid, must first be approved. Staff members must also inform their manager if:

* their spouse is employed and where; or
* a personal interest that might impair their independence or any other conflict of interest occurs, in the course of performance of their duties.

## Receiving gifts

Members of the Foundation for Public Code staff may not accept gifts, payment, or favours from any non-member organizations, individuals, or third parties without obtaining prior permission.

As an exception a gift can be accepted without prior approval when:

* there is a cultural, social or diplomatic obligation to accept the gift,
* the value of the gift does not exceed â‚¬50,
* and there is no accumulation.

If hospitality is included in the participation of a mission, conference, workshop or other meeting that has been approved it will not require separate approval.

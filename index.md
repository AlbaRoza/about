# What we do

We help public Open Source projects become successful, build sustainable communities around them and create a thriving public Open Source ecology.

We want to be an ecosystem level partner in Open Source projects enabling collaboration and re-use at scale.

Our [mission](mission.md) is to create a viable future for cities and civic operating systems that are highly participatory and drive societal engagement.

## We need you!

We can [really use your help](README.md) in setting up the Foundation For Public Code and making it successful.

# Activities

## Product Stewardship

We help public source code & policy code products be successful by guaranteeing their marketability and quality. Trustworthy, usable, maintained and sustainable code & code for your city.

We provide the following for products, projects and codebases in our care:

* IP management, product stewardship
* Code, policy and documentation quality assurance
* Productization services: branding, communication, refactoring for reuse
* Community management: processing feedback and contributions, events
* Packaging, distributing official versions, compatibility updating
* Marketing, communications, public relations
* Developer advocacy, user support, end-user success, training materials
* Project infrastructure, process management

### Making collaboration across contexts possible

We provide these services explicitly at _ecosystem level_ – not at a national or city level – to make sure that context specific code or policy does not become a barrier to implementation.
This means that we make sure that code is reusable across contexts globally.

For local implementations we collaborate with local implementation partners, working actively with them to both integrate effectively in the local context while simultaneously making it easier for others to implement as well.

# When sick

If you are feeling sick you might not be able to perform your work, or even worse jeapardise the stability of the organization.

Staff of the Foundation for Public Code is always payed whilst sick, 100% the first year and 70% the second.

## Can you go to work

If you feel sick then do not go to the office.

If you feel well enough to work but there is a chance others might get sick from contact with you, work from home.

If you do not feel that you can perform your work at your usual abilities it is important that you don't work.

## Call in sick

Before 9am on the first day of sickness you need to call in sick.
This is also true on a day you were planning to work from home or on a work day on which you have taken off.

Report by calling your manager at +31 20 2 444 555 and sending an email to <hr@publiccode.net>.

Don't forget to let your colleagues know as well.

## Returning to work

Let <hr@publiccode.net> know when you resume your regular work.

Please do this the afternoon before you plan to be back in the next day. Or if you are well again and the next day is not a work day for you.

You can always call again the next day that you were too optimistic (and need to stay home a bit longer).
Alternatively email the morning (when you resume work), at the latest.

This is important as HR needs to end the notification of your sickness in the HR portal. 
This avoids action by the [arbo-dienst](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbodienst) and extra high premiums related to  high rates of sick leave) as well as us knowing you are back in.

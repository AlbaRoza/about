# When sick

If you are feeling sick you might not be able to perform your work, or even worse jeopardise the stability of the organization.

Staff of the Foundation for Public Code is always paid whilst sick, 100% the first year of sickness and 70% the second year. Of course we will work together in your being able to return to work as soon as possible, in accordance with the law (Wet Poortwachter) and in collaboration with the occupational health and safety service (arbo-dienst) the Foundation has contracted for this purpose.

## Can you go to work

If you feel sick then do not go to the office.

If you feel well enough to work, but there is a chance others might get sick from contact with you, work from home.

If you do not feel that you can perform your work at your usual abilities it is important that you don't work.

## Call in sick

On the first day of sickness you need to call in sick, before 9am. Please call HR, and if they cannot be reached, call your manager.
This is also true on a day you were planning to work from home or on a work day on which you have taken off.

HR (or your manager) will inform your colleagues so that plans can be altered if need be.

## Returning to work

Let <hr@publiccode.net> know when you resume your regular work.

Please do this the afternoon before you plan to be back in the next day. Or if you are well again and the next day is not a work day for you.

You can always call again the next day that you were too optimistic (and need to stay home a bit longer).
Alternatively, email the morning (when you resume work), at the latest.

This is important as HR needs to end the notification of your sickness in the HR portal. 
This avoids action by the [arbo-dienst](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbodienst) and extra high premiums related to  high rates of sick leave) as well as us knowing you are back in.

# Travel

Due to the international nature of the work we do, working for the Foundation for Public Code involves travelling.

When you are travelling for work you are representing the Foundation for Public Code.

## Planning

Please schedule your travel in the team calendar, so that your colleagues can see if they can expect to meet with you or call you while you're away. Don't forget to take time zones into account.

## Booking

Book transportation according to our [remuneration policy](../../organization/remuneration-policy.md) and keep in mind our [procurement principles](../procurement/principles.md).

Tips:

* Make sure you have good connections as well as leaving time and space to settle into a hotel.
* Travelling inside business hours might help you make sure you don't have to go to bed without dinner before representing the Foundation for Public Code the next morning.
* Make sure your accomodation has a stable internet connection and access to necessary facilities like an ironing board.
* When attending an event, it might pay to have accomodation near the event in order to maximize participation.
* Book an accommodation where you know what to expect, so you are not faced by surprises.

# Expenses

In order to achieve our mission we need to spend money.
For larger institutional expenses we pay invoices from our bank account.
For smaller expenses it might be practical for staff to pay for them and file an expense report with the relevant documentation.

As a matter of professional bookkeeping practice we will always have the complete documentation for each expense, and will also make sure that expenses are not only documented properly but also proper per s√©. We actively strive to reduce the overhead of processing invoices, as well as reduce access risks.

What you can expense is described in our [remuneration policy](../../organization/remuneration-policy.md).

## How to submit expense forms

As a staff member you can get reimbursed for your expenses in the NMBRS employee app.

How to submit an expense form:

1. Login to your employee account. If you have not received a login, request one at <hr@publiccode.net>.
2. Open the menu and select 'Mutation Forms.'
3. Press 'New mutation form' and select 'Expense declaration' from the menu revealing the form.
4. In the form under type select:
   * 'Declaratie onkosten' for general expenses,
   * 'Reiskostenvergoeding' for expenses related to travel,
   * 'Aantal Kilometers' for travel in your own vehicle.
5. At the 'Start date' fill in the relevant date.
6. At the 'Value' fill in the amount corresponding to the documentation you have.
7. At the 'Description', describe your expense.
8. Add a photo of the documentation as an attachment.
9. Press send to submit the expense.

The expense can now be approved by your manager, followed by an approval step by the accountant.
Expense requests may be rejected or returned to you for further clarification or documentation through the NMBRS app as well.
After approval the reimbursement is added to your next salary.

## Expenses of non-staff

For expenses done by volenteers and non-staff an expense form can be submitted.
This form can be received from your contracting contact.

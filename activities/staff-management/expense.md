# Expenses

In order to achieve our mission we need to spend money.
For larger institutional expenses we pay invoices from our bank account.
For smaller expenses we request staff to pay for this and file an expense report with the relevant documentation.

We do this in order to make sure we always have the proper documentation, reduce the overhead of processing invoices, as well as reduce access risks.

What you can expense is described in our [remuneration policy](../../organization/remuneration-policy.md).

## How to submit expense forms

As a staff member you can get reimbursed for your expenses in the NMBRS employee app.

How to submit an expense form:

1. Login to your employee account. If you have not received a login, request one at <hr@publiccode.net>.
2. Open the menu and select 'Mutation Forms.'
3. Press 'New mutation form' and select 'Expense declaration' from the menu revealing the form.
4. In the form under type select:
   * 'Declaratie onkosten' for general expenses,
   * 'Reiskostenvergoeding' for expenses related to travel,
   * 'Aantal Kilometer' for travel in your own vehicle.
5. At the 'Start date' fill in the relevant date.
6. At the 'Value' fill in the amount corresponding to the documentation you have.
7. At the 'Description', describe your expense.
8. Add a photo of the documentation as an attachment.
9. Press send to submit the expense.

The expense can now be approved by your manager, followed by the accountant.
After approval the reimbursement is added to your salary.

Your manager can request improvements to your expense report through the NMBRS app as well.

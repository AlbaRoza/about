# Taking leave

## Vacation

You need to plan your vacation together with your direct colleagues and your manager.
Please add your vacation to your calendar so that colleagues don't invite you to meetings or events.

Staff have a limited amount of vacation days.
Make sure to take all vacation days off every year.
More days can be bought at cost rate in agreement of your manager and <hr@publiccode.net>.

Vacation can be requested through the NMBRS employee app.

### Sick while on vacation leave

If you are sick while on leave [report it](sickness.md).
This will ensure you get your vacation days used while sick back.

## Emergency leave for personal matters

Employees can be entitled to emergency leave for urgent, unforeseen or special personal circumstances.
Such emergency leave can last from a few hours to a few days, depending on the situation.
Emergency leave is payed leave and is separate from vacation.

Please report taking emergency leave as soon as possible (and not longer than 24 hours after leaving) to your manager in order to discuss the terms.

Emergency leave is not requested or logged through the NMBRS employee app.

# Taking leave

## Vacation

You need to plan your vacation together with your direct colleagues and your manager.
Please add your vacation to your calendar so that colleagues don't invite you to events.

Staff have a limited amount of vacation days.
More days can be bought at cost rate in agreement of your manager and <hr@publiccode.net>.

## Sick whilst on vacation leave

If you are sick whilst on leave [report it](sickness.md).
This will ensure you get your vacation days used whilst sick back.

## Emergency leave for personal matters

If something bad happens to you or someone close to you it is important to take immediate emergency leave.

Employees can be entitled to emergency leave for urgent, unforeseen or special personal circumstances.
Such emergency leave can last from a few hours to a few days, depending on the situation.
The Foundation for Public Code continues to pay the salary during the leave, without this employee costing vacation or overtime.

Please report taking emergency leave as soon as possible (and not longer than 24 hours after leaving) to your manager in order to discuss the terms and <hr@publiccode.net>.

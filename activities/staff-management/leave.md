# Taking leave

## Vacation

You need to plan your vacation together with your direct colleagues and your manager.
Please add your vacation to your calendar so that colleagues don't invite you to meetings or events.

Staff have a limited amount of vacation days.
Make sure to take all vacation days off every year.
More days can be bought at cost rate in agreement of your manager and <hr@publiccode.net>.

### How to request vacation leave

Vacation can be requested through the NMBRS employee app.

1. Login to your employee account. If you have not received a login, request one at <hr@publiccode.net>.
2. Open the menu and select 'Leave'.
3. Press 'New Request'.
4. Select 'More than one day' or 'One day'.
5. Select the start and end date of your leave.

### Sick while on vacation leave

## Emergency leave for personal matters

Employees can be entitled to emergency leave for urgent, unforeseen or special personal circumstances.
Such emergency leave can last from a few hours to a few days, depending on the situation.

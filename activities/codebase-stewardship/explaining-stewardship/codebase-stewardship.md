## Points to get across

* In line with our [mission], the Foundation for Public Code does codebase stewardship for [public code] codebases.
* This includes our particular flavour of community, quality, support and product stewardship as detailed on our [codebase stewardship activities page]
* The value proposition of our stewardship is on our [value proposition mapping page].

# Codebases can be shared

## Diagram

## Points to get across
 
* A component's codebase is its blueprint; the set of code, tests and documentation that make up that component
* A codebase can be copied, or forked, and adapted to a different context (manipulating data and interacting with other software)
* Adapting a codebase to a new context includes adapting to existing components, structures and workflows of the organization and people, and how it is inteded to be used
* Different components can be based on the same codebase
* A single codebase can contain the bluepints for several different modifications for differently modified components

## Examples

### Metaphorical

A codebase is like a blueprint. You can can have a blue print for the water pipes in an appartment building. Once this blue print is implemented as a component of an actual building, it will be adapted slightly to that building. The residents may install showers or baths, and upgrade boilers differently. However, if in one building they realise that installing a more powerful pump in the basement helps maintain pressure on the top floor, this can be included in the original blueprint as a reference for all current and future buildings.

# Codebases can be shared

## Points to get across

* A component's codebase is its blueprint: the set of code, tests and documentation that make up that component
* A codebase can be copied, or forked, and adapted to a different context (manipulating data and interacting with other software)
* Adapting a codebase to a new context includes modifying existing components, structures and workflows for the organization and people, and how it is intended to be used
* A single codebase can contain the blueprints for several different adaptations for differently modified components
* Different components can be based on the same codebase

## Examples

### Metaphorical

A codebase is like a blueprint. You can can have a blueprint for the water pipes in an apartment building. Once this blueprint is implemented as a component in an actual building, it will be adapted slightly to that building. The residents may install showers or baths, and upgrade boilers differently. However, if in one building they realise that installing a more powerful pump in the basement helps maintain pressure on the top floor, this can be included in the original blueprint as a reference for all current and future buildings.

# Activities performed in codebase stewardship

Stewardship activities take place in 4 domains: community, product marketing, quality and support.

## Community

Successful open source codebases build a diverse community of municipalities and vendors to implement and support the product. This includes multiple municipalities contracting new development work, and multiple developing parties adding code to the Github repository.

The Foundation for Public Code will help facilitate these interactions around the code - by for example setting up community calls and forums, answering questions for newcomers, and facilitating the governance and technical steering in a way that is open and inclusive to everyone working at the code level (including developers, implementers, and open source enthusiasts). This will help avoid duplicate work, and ensure new actors beyond those already involved can join and participate easily.

Community stewardship includes:

* Supporting, consulting on and executing governance
* Supporting committees such as technical steering committees
* Organizing events
* Processing feedback and contributions
* Organizing [community calls](https://hackmd.io/@clausmullie/BJGGtcGRE)

## Quality

Successful open source codebases leverage economies of scale in a decentralised manner - various developers add features and fixing bugs, while various implementers support municipalities in their implementations.

The Foundation for Public Code will help guarantee that all the code and corresponding documentation is ready for reuse. This includes a quality check on all new code added to the GitHub repository, and making sure everything is properly explained so other people can use it in their work. This helps all parties involved to trust each other’s code and work - allowing them to build on each other.

Quality stewardship includes:

* [Codebase auditing](../codebase-auditing/index.md): code, policy and documentation quality assurance
* Packaging and distributing official versions
* Security and compatibility monitoring
* Monitoring codebase compliance towards any future versions of the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/)

## Support

Successful open source codebases build a diverse vendor network for development, maintenance, implementation and hosting.

The Foundation for Public Code explicitly looks at the code and documentation from a vendor perspective, to help make sure it is commercially viable for them to work with the codebase. This could include hosting introductory open days to the codebase, giving training to new vendors, helping to resolve questions and doubts, and facilitating communication with their client municipalities.

Support stewardship includes:

* User support
* Trainings
* Project infrastructure and process management
* Intellectual property management and trademark protection
* Support with vendor relations, including maintenance, implementation and integration partners as well as hosting providers.

## Product

Successful open source codebases involve a wide community to parttake in the actions described above.

The Foundation for Public Code will support the marketing of codebases to reach municipalities and vendors beyond (the network of) the current consortium. This can include help with the codebase’s branding, storytelling and marketing assets. This will help make the codebase attractive internationally and to new vendors, and easier to scale in the local context.

Product marketing stewardship includes:

* Codebase branding
* Codebase storytelling, communications and public relations
* Marketing
* Developer advocacy

## We represent the codebase

We work to further the [goals of codebase stewardship](goals.md).
We represent the future of the codebase and community.
We do not work to serve the needs of community members individually.
We serve the needs of the community as a whole.

## Only at the ecosystem level

Our role in the development and community of a codebase is to maximize reuse.
We perform the activities in codebase stewardship exclusively at the [ecosystem level](../../glossary/ecosystem-level-definition.md).
We intentionally do not work on a local level or a tied to a specific legal context as it is our responsibility to keep the code reusable and the community inclusive.

# Criteria  for codebase stewardship

These are the criteria for codebase stewardship used before and after the 'Assess' phase in the codebase stewardship lifecycle. The staff of the Foundation for Public Code will use these to help evaluate whether a codebase is ready/condusive for incubation. They are in no particular order of importance.


* Community
   * Does the codebase have an active and engaged community?
* Community potential
   * Is there a strong potential for the community to grow beyond its existing members?
* Code reusability
   * Is the code written in a way that makes it easy to be reused? 
* Co-develop-ability
   * Does the codebase lend itself to collaborative development?
* Reuse potential
   * To what extent can the codebase be reused, both in a different context and/or for a different purpose?
* Societal impact 
   * What is the potential societal impact of the codebase becoming Public Code and being reused?
* Business case(s)
   * What is/are the business case(s) for the codebase becoming Public Code and being reused?
* Story
  * What is the story-telling and communication value of this codebase becoming Public Code and being reused?

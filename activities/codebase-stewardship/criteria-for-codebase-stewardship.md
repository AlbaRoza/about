# Criteria  for codebase stewardship

Here are the criteria the staff of the Foundation for Public Code will use to help evaluate whether a codebase is ready for/conducive to incubation. They are used before and after the 'Assess' phase in the [codebase stewardship lifecycle](lifecycle.md). 

* Business case(s): what is/are the business case(s) for the codebase becoming public code and being reused?
* Co-develop-ability: does the codebase lend itself to collaborative development?
* Community: does the codebase have an active and engaged community?
* Community potential: is there a strong potential for the community to grow beyond its existing members?
* Code reusability: is the code written in a way that makes it easy to be reused? 
* Reuse potential: to what extent can the codebase be reused, both in a different context or for a different purpose?
* Societal impact: what is the potential societal impact of the codebase becoming public code and being reused?
* Story: what is the story-telling and communication value of this codebase becoming public code and being reused?  

Note: These are not ordered by importance.

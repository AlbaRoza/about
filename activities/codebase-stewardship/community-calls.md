# Community calls

## What is a community call?

In order to enabling different kinds of knowledge sharing we organize a video call every two weeks. The call goes on for about an hour and usually focuses on one topic. The agenda is shared before the meeting and notes are being taken. After the community call a cleaned up version of the notes will be sent out for comments to the participants and then published on our blog.

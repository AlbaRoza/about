# Deciding to attend an event

We send people to events/conferences for 2 reasons:

* as part of a delegation to that event, with explicit goals we want to achieve and people we want to meet (strong, impactful presence)
* for personal development - to learn more about an area, to deepen their skills, expertise and network in that area

We have different decision making criteria for these 2 types of event attendance.

A staff member that wants to propose an event to attend should decide which of these to use and make proposal for the CEO to make a decision on.

## Delegation

When considering whether to attend an event, the most important question to answer is:

How does sending a delegation to an event further our [mission](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html)?

The size and makeup of the delegation should be based on what is most likely to help us further mission.

You should also consider the costs (for example, cost of missing the event, opportunity cost of staff being at the event, and financial cost of the travel, logistics and any ticket). These need not be precise numbers, but should give a rough estimate on the total costs.


## Personal development

Another reason for attending events is for staff members to get personal growth and extend their skill sets. Choosing events to attend should be personalized for the staff member's role and career ambitions.

Personal development trajectories should be discussed in your 1-1s with your manager. This will enable both you and your manager to easily spot opportunities you might be interested in.

Get your manager's support for your proposal to attend an event for personal development before you email the CEO.

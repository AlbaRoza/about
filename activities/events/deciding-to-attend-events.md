# Deciding to attend an event



## Event types

We send people to events/conferences for 2 reasons:

* as part of a delegation to that event, with explicit goals we want to achieve and people we want to meet (strong, impactful presence)
* for personal development - to learn more about an area, to deepen their skills, expertise and network in that area

We have different decision making criteria for these 2 types of event attendance.

### Delegation

When considering whether to attend an event, the most important question to answer is:

How does sending a delegation to an event further our [mission](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html)?

* Figure out the purpose of attending the event. Which are the goals that the organization is trying to achieve by attending this event? Make sure these are aligned with the overarching [mission and principles](../../organization/mission.md). The goals usually determine who represents the organization at the event. Decide how you'll measure if the goals were met after the event.

* Consider how many people you should send to cover everything needed for the goals to be met (especially with large events)

You should also consider the costs (for example, cost of missing the event, opportunity cost of staff being at the event, and financial cost of the travel, logistics and any ticket). These need not be precise numbers, but should give a rough estimate on the total costs.

### Personal development

Another reason for attending events is for staff members to get personal growth and extend their skill sets. Choosing events to attend should be personalized for the staff member's role and career ambitions.

Personal development trajectories should be discussed in your 1-1s with your manager. This will enable both you and your manager to easily spot opportunities you might be interested in.

Get your manager's support for your proposal to attend an event for personal development before you email the CEO.

## How to get approval for attending an event

A staff member that wants to propose an event to attend should:

* decide which type of event it is
* email a proposal for the CEO to make a decision on (including your analysis)

If the CEO approves, [follow the event attendance guidance](attending-events.md).

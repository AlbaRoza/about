# Governance game workshop session proposal

This is a proposal for doing a workshop with the governance game at an external event like a conference or similar.

## Target audience

Anyone who is interested in governance of collaboratively developed software. It works best with a group of people with mixed backgrounds and experiences including at least one developer and one civil servant.

## Requirements

A table that participants can stand around and all interact with cards that are being put on the table.

## Time

We suggest a 40-45 minute time slot. The game itself can be played in 30 minutes, whereas the reminder time is used to refection of how it played out.

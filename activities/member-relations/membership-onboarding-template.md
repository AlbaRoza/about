# Membership onboarding proposal template

## Goal

This document serves as a draft onboarding proposal to send to public organizations that are exploring joining the Foundation for Public Code as a member.

## Resource

You can access the [membership onboarding template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-pOyoMvHCjSzMt8YiI6dj7tmP4v9Mbd9sthTyM9pCA/).

## Assumptions

* Our strategy is to work with our contacts within the organization to make a convincing proposal to their relevant level of political decision-making
* This resource is a link to a Google doc for now, but might change format
* Any proposed changes to the content of this template must first be proposed on, and merged with, [the `master` branch of About](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/tree/master) before being implemented here

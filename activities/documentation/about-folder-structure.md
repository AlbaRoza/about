# Folder structure of the about

The about has a folder structure that serves as a basic skeleton for our information.

* `activities`: All of our activities, processes and services such as codebase stewardship and budgeting.
  * Inside of activities there is a folder per activity with their own index, resources and guides.
* `contributor-guides`: Per user type how they can contribute. For e.g. designers, developers or policy people.
* `glossary`: The controlled terms we have a shared definition for.
* `organisation`: Core information on the organization such as the mission, statues and business information.
* `roles`: The roles we have in the organization, also known as job descriptions.

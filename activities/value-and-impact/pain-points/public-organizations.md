As public organizations mature in their approaches to their digital public infrastructure, typical challenges include: 

* **Operational delivery**: developing the exertise to operationally manage digital innovation projects, including in-house development, procurement, and the management of third party vendors, often without in-house technical expertise 
* **Economies of scale and silos**: learning to work together with partner-organizations to collaborative around a single shared system, rather than each having their own 
* **Sustainable relationships with third parties**: avoiding lock-in situations, in which the organization's data and/or digital workflow is controlled by an third party, leading to a reduced autonomy and potentially prohibitive liscensing, upgrade and migration costs
* **Future-proofing**: understanding how decisions about their digital public infrastructure will open up or limit possibility of future upgrades, add-ons and innovation potential in the future
* **Technical debt**: working around an ever increasing set of aging digital systems that create dependies and a potential drag on service delivery
* **Balancing local and global**: stiking a balance between existing offers of global parties, while still investing in local businesses

# Reducing costs of future codebase

## Need/problem: 

* organization(s) developing a new codebase with a high reuse potential

## Value proposition of codebase stewardship: 

* Open source means:
  * Multiple parties can codevelop and reuse the codebase

* Codebase stewardship helps:
  * Quality
    * Ensure all parties work to the same quality standards 
  * Community
    * Enable multiple parties to pool resources and facilitate the collaborative governance of the project
  * Support
    * Enable a diverse set of parties to participate, including in-house and contracted development 
    
* This helps to reduce the code of the codebase by:
  * Inspire trust in code and governance so all parties can commit resources, enabling economies of scale to deliver value at reduced cost for all parties 
  * Collaborative design improves the quality and increases the further likelihood of codebase scalability and reusability 

## Business case: 

* Finding codeveloping parties significantly reduces the capex required for development and opex for future maintenance and features

## Strenghts:

* Significant, direct and easily visibile capex reduction
* High likelihood of opex reduction

## Weaknesses:

* Dificult to identify common needs and get parties to agree to codevelopment

## Example:

# Reducing risk of future codebase

## Need/problem 

* organization(s) procuring or building a large and complex codebase(s)

## Value proposition of codebase stewardship 

* Open source means: 
  * Code is published in the open, so it can be reviewed, audited and built upon by others 

* Codebase stewardship mandated to all participating parties, including contractors, helps:
  * Quality: 
    * Continous integration in the open by all parties
    * Compliance to standard as minimum quality benchmark by all parties, including documentation and legibility of code
  * Community: 
    * Better collaboration between involved parties

* This helps reduce the risk of the codebase with:
  * Improved collaboration between involved parties greatly reduces risk of 'Frankenstein' outcome
  * Higher redundancy of parties (suppliers can drop out, take over each other's work, be replaced)
  * Better componentization of code means work can be salvaged and reused/developed in different direction in case of problems 

## Business case 

* A small percentage of project capex expenditure in order to reduce the risk of a large complex project failing, improving return on investment

## Strengths

* Easy to rationalize % of existing capex to increase return on investment
* Financial burden can be spread amoung participating/benefiting parties

## Weaknesses:

* Projet can still 'fail' despite our activities being 'successful'
* Membership dues should be opex and beyond project lifetime 

## Example:

* Implementations of EU standards (Connecting Europe Facility-style)

# Reducing risks of existing codebase

## Need/problem: 

* Organization(s) with large codebase(s) with high technical debt, either in production or failed development not in production. 

## Value proposition of codebase stewardship: 

* Open source means:
  * Code can be evaluated post-development to salvage and extract useful work and/or surface and fix problems

* Codebase stewardship during the refactoring of the codebase helps:
  * Quality: 
    * Improve quality of refactored components to make them reusable 
  * Community: 
    * Improve coordination of various parties working to do analysis of existing code

* This serves to derisk the codebase by:
  * Lift the codebase out of technical debt, improving uptime, maintenance requirements, etc 
  * Salvage individual high value components for reuse and/or further development

## Business case: 

* Reduce maintenance opex for codebases in production
* Salvage capex sunk cost of past capex in failed developments

## Strengths:

* Addresses clear 'pain point' for organization
* If 'failed' codebase with high sunk cost - potential high-profile reputational gains
* If codebase in production - easy to rationalise reduction in opex cost

## Weaknesses:

* Requires intensive additional capex investment in refactoring codebase
* Success is after 'completion', with risk of never achieving and reputational risk
* Low probability of full certification of codebase

## Example:

* Operatie BRP

# Business case typology for codebase stewardship 

The Foundation's mission is to enable public software and policy that is open and collaborative. It does this through [codebase stewardship](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/). 

Making a business case for codebase stewardship includes multi-faceted value propositios at different timescales. 

Our founding members are 'mature' organizations who understand the value proposition and have either self-diagnosed the 'need' and/or have experience with (parts) of our 'activities'.

In order to improve the understanding of codebase stewardship, and help members make the business case for codebase stewardship, this resource maps out different typologies of use cases, corresponding value propositions and associated busines cases.

For each typology it maps:
* Need/problem of the organization
* Value proposition of codebase stewardship
* Business case for the organization
* Strengths
* Weaknesses
* Example

The typologies are based on the 4 axes of our value proposition:
* Reduce Risk
* Reduce Cost
* Improve Quality
* Improve Control

Currently mapped typologies include:
* Reducing risk of future codebase
* Reducing risks of existing codebase
* Reducing costs of future codebase
* Reducing costs of current codebase
* Improving control of core operations

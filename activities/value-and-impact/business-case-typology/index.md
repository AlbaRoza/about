# Business case typology for codebase stewardship 

This index provides a typology to help create business cases for codebase stewardship. 

## Context 

The Foundation's mission is to enable public software and policy that is open and collaborative.
It does this through [codebase stewardship](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/). 

Making a business case for codebase stewardship includes multi-faceted value propositions at different timescales.
This typology provides a set of mental models to help identify the most likely value proposition, and corresponding business case, for investing in codebase stewardship.

## How the typology is structured

The typologies are based on the 4 axes of our value proposition:

* Reduce Risk
* Reduce Cost
* Improve Quality
* Improve Control

For each typology it maps:

* The initial state of the codebase
* The value proposition of codebase stewardship
* The corresponding business case for the maintaining organizations of investing in codebase stewardship
* Strengths of making a business case in this scenario
* Weaknesses of making a business case in this scenario
* Example for this typology

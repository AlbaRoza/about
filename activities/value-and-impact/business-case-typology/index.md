# Business case typology for codebase stewardship 

This index provides a typology to help create business cases for codebase stewardship. 

## Context 

The Foundation's mission is to enable public software and policy that is open and collaborative.
It does this through [codebase stewardship](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/). 

Making a business case for codebase stewardship includes multi-faceted value propositios at different timescales.
Starting from the initial state of the codebase, this typology provides a set of tools that can be used to analyse the most likely value proposition, and corresponding business case, for investing in codebase stewardship.

## How the typology is structured

For each typology it maps:

* The current state of the codebase
* The value proposition of codebase stewardship
* The corresponding business case for the maintaining organizations
* Strengths of making a business case in this scenario
* Weaknesses of making a business case in this scenario
* Example

The typologies are based on the 4 axes of our value proposition:

* Reduce Risk
* Reduce Cost
* Improve Quality
* Improve Control

## Currently mapped typologies

* [Reducing risk of future codebase](risk-of-future-codebase.md)
* [Reducing risks of existing codebase](risk-of-existing-codebase.md)
* [Reducing costs of future codebase](cost-of-future-codebase.md)
* [Reducing costs of current codebase](costs-of-current-codebase.md)
* [Improving control of core operations](control-of-core-operations.md)

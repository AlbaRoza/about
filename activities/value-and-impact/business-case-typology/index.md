# Business case typology for codebase stewardship 

The Foundation's mission is to enable public software and policy that is open and collaborative. It does this through [codebase stewardship]. Codebase stewardship is a complex 'product' to 'market' as it has a multi-faceted value proposition at different timescales. 

Our current model is 'trust-based sell' with known organizations in our network. These are 'mature' organizations who understand the value proposition and have either self-diagnosed the 'need' and/or iterated on (parts) of our 'product'.

In order to improve the understanding of codebase stewardship, this resource maps out different typologies of use cases and corresponding value propositions and busines cases.

For each typology it maps:
* Need/problem of the organization
* Value proposition of codebase stewardship
* Business case for the organization
* Strengths
* Weaknesses
* Example

The typologies are based on the 4 axes of our value proposition:
* Reduce Risk
* Reduce Cost
* Improve Quality
* Improve Control

Currently mapped typologies include:
* Reducing risk of future codebases
* Reducing risks of existing codebases
* Reducing costs of future codebases
* Reducing costs of current codebases
* Improving control of core operations

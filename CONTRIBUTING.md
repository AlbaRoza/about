# Join us

Thanks for your interest in the Foundation for Public Code! We’re excited to meet you.

There’s lots of work going on as we start the Foundation - we’d love your help with this.

In 2019 we’re focused on:

+ designing and testing our codebase stewardship processes
+ establishing relationships with the Foundation’s founding members (public organisations)

We plan to scale in 2020.

In the meantime, please join us in any way you can.

## Individual contributors

Our [contributor guide for individuals](contributor-guide/individual) explains how to find out what we’re currently working on and what we’re looking for help with.  

We’re especially interested in learning what you need to implement the [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/) in your organisation. Please [raise an issue](http://standard.publiccode.net/CONTRIBUTING.html) or email us at <info@publiccode.net>.

## Public organisations

We’re currently looking for innovative public organisations to join us as founding members. As a founding member, you’ll have the chance to shape the Foundation’s processes and governance. Your code will be among the first accepted for Foundation stewardship. Lead the community of enterprising public organisations creating public code to power their digital transformations.

If this sounds like your organisation, email us at <membership@publiccode.net>.

## Institutional giving and philanthropy

If you believe there should be a structural solution to making open source software viable at scale for public organisations, we’d love to hear from you. Email us at <giving@publiccode.net>.

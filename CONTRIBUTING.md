## Contributing

Please feel free to file Issues and Pull Requests with any suggestions about our organisation, improvements to our communications and so on. We can use the help!

Check out the [Roadmap for this project](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/projects/1) to see what we're prioritising right now.

The only ones allowed to merge Pull Requests into `develop` or `master` are the members of the Directors of the Foundation For Public Code GitHub organisation (@publiccodenet/directors).

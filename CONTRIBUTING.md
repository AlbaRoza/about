# Contributor Guide üôá‚Äç

The Foundation For Public Code has [a mission to develop an Open Source ecosystem for cities](mission.md). In order to fulfill our mission we ‚Äì the directors of the Foundation, our advisors and contributors ‚Äì need your help!

This repository serves as the 'official source of truth' about the Foundation For Public Code. It contains all of its documentation, procedures and information as well as explanations on what the Foundation For Public Code does. We see it a bit like a 'living' charter.

In this guide we try to set out all the ways you can contribute to the Foundation For Public Code.

## How you can help


### Advise us and help us solve issues

Please look at [the list of Issues marked 'Help Wanted'](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/labels/help%20wanted), these are all of the issues (and proposed changes to content) where we feel we need help.

All of the issues that we're working on and prioritising are on the [Kanban Board for this project](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/projects/1).

### Identify issues we need to solve

If you have any suggestion about our organisation, improvements to our documentation and communications or questions we invite you to [file an Issue](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/issues/new).

For instance you could give us feedback on this guide, the [README](README.md) or any other file in this repository.

Resolving these issues is a community effort as well, so be sure to clearly describe what you mean as others might not have the same context that you have.

### Pull requests

Feel free to suggest changes to the content in a Pull Requests.

This repository is automatically converted into a website with Jekyll and GitHub pages, so make sure that every file you contribute is valid [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you want to you can also [build and preview the website locally](README.md) before you make a Pull Request.

As per [the content governance guide](GOVERNANCE.md) Pull Requests can only be merged into `develop` or `master` after being reviewed by a director.

### Contribute to our projects

And of course we'd love input into our projects as well, like [`publiccode.yml`](https://github.com/publiccodenet/publiccode.yml).

## Contributing

The Foundation For Public Code has [a mission to develop an Open Source ecosystem for cities](mission.md). In order to fulfill our mission we – the directors of the Foundation, our advisors and contributors – need your help!

This repository serves as the 'official source of truth' about the Foundation For Public Code. It contains all of its documentation, procedures and information as well as explanations on what the Foundation For Public Code does. We see it a bit like a 'living' charter.

In this guide we try to set out all the ways you can contribute to the Foundation For Public Code.

## How you can help

Please feel free to file Issues and Pull Requests with any suggestions about our organisation, improvements to our communications and so on. We can use the help!

Check out the [Roadmap for this project](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/projects/1) to see what we're prioritising right now.

As per [the content governance guide](GOVERNANCE.md) Pull Requests can only be merged into `develop` or `master` after being reviewed by a director.
